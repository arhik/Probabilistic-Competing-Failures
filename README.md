In a Body Sensor Network, the sensors information is relayed through relay within reach wirelessly. There is a possibility of relay failure. Considering this a new component PDEP is introduced into fault tolerance literature.

The Fault tree diagram of the above description is shown below.

In this project the wireless motes may fail because of sensor failure or tranmission failures and the components may be isolated. ()

The monte-carlo simulation of the above scenario is done to compute its reliability.
