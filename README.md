In a Body Sensor Network, the sensors information is relayed through relay within reach wirelessly. There is a possibility of relay failure. Considering this a new component PDEP is introduced into fault tolerance literature.

In this project the wireless motes may fail because of sensor failure or tranmission failure. 

The monte-carlo simulation of the above scenario is done to compute its reliability.

The Fault tree diagram of the above description is shown below.
